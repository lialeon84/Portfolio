	 <p class="bio">
	Rosa Vergel is currently working as a customer service agent. 
	She has been in the customer service profession for over 
	ten years. A couple of year ago a friend who study web development 
	recommended her to try it out for free by going to a website 
	call codeacadamy.com. She fell in love with the program and 
	decided it was for her. She is currently a student at the 
	Vanderbilt University code boot camp pursuing her 
	certification as a web developer.
