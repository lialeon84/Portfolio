	I'm currently working as a technical service agent. 
	I have been in the technical service profession for over 
	ten years. A couple of year ago a friend who study web development 
	suggested I should to try out coding. She suggested various websites I would be able to try for free before fully engaging in the program.
	As soon a I created my first website I fell in love with the program and 
	decided it was for me. I'm currently a student at the 
	Vanderbilt University pursuing my certification as a full-stack web developer.
