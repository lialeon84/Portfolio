	 <p class="bio">
	I'm currently working as a technical service agent. 
	I have been in the technical service profession for over 
	ten years. A couple of year ago a friend who study web development 
	recommended to try out coding for free at a website 
	called codeacadamy.com. I fell in love with the program and 
	decided it was for me. I am currently a student at the 
	Vanderbilt University pursuing my certification as a full-stack web developer.
